# Geocoder Photon

For this work, we used the geocoder photon.
In our code, we are using the running photon geocoder from komoot, which is available under this url: http://photon.komoot.de/api/?
When you run this project it is also possible to run your own geocoder.
We will give you all important information and provide a data folder, so you can run with Baden-Württemberg (from: December 2019)

## Installation

find information about komoot : https://github.com/komoot/photon
Here you can find the last release: https://github.com/komoot/photon/releases

To fill it with data you can
1. Use the planet file from Graphhopper
2. Build a Nominatim (https://github.com/openstreetmap/Nominatim) and fill a postgres/postgis with a osm-file from Geofabrik (https://download.geofabrik.de/)
3. Use the data folder from this repository (Baden-Württemberg, Germany December 2019) and copy it in the same folder than your photon-*.jar
