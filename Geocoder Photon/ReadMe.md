# Geocoder Photon

For this work, we used the geocoder Photon.
In our code, we are using the running Photon geocoder from komoot, which is available under this URL: http://photon.komoot.de/api/?

If you run this project it is also possible to not use the Photon geocoder from komoot but to run your own Photon.
In the "Installation" section all the important information is given.

To fill it with data you can
